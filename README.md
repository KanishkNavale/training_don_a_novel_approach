### Abstract:
Our work proposes a novel framework that addresses the computational limitations associated with training Dense Object Nets (DON)
while achieving robust and dense visual object descriptors. DON's descriptors are known for their robustness to
viewpoint and configuration changes, but training these requires image pairs with computationally expensive correspondence mapping.
This limitation hampers dimensionality and robustness, thereby restricting object generalization.
To overcome this, we introduce a data generation procedure using synthetic augmentation and a novel deep-learning architecture
that produces denser visual descriptors with reduced computational demands. Notably, our framework eliminates the need for
image pair correspondence mapping and showcases its application in a robotic grasping pipeline.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach yields descriptors as robust as those generated by DON.
